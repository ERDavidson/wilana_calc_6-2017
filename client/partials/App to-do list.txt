Property Tax view:
make property tax for individual units match history / standardize algorithm

Budget view
- hardcode or make simple db.  Frills here will wait for later
- one such frill:  past budgets
- anothe frill:  How much of your dues will be funding what


spending history issues
-figure out nvd3 margins
-link dues & assessment & fee income history to actual transactions
-make spending categories togglable on graph


implement google oauth
	documents view
	make client-side view restrictions for login in general & for shareholder-users

filter issues
-display of applied filters is so wide it forces main below options
-shrink filter options
-why 2 dues
-multi-filtering is still terrible
-I think object referencing is tying active filters to proposed & triggering digest just for clicking opition buttons
-filter restore is bugged - I think because it iterates through the active filter, which is missing properties completely that it should be restoring

data issues
-22's balance is fucked up
-21's transactions


minor tweaks

clearer system for subviews - want to avoid someone clicking on an upper line link and wondering why nothing obvious happens
remove cursor from button labels
transaction searches sort weirdly with multiple filters clicking on and off
also managed to see all of 5&22's credits & otherfees even though credits was not tapped.
add date filter
get dues to show up in filtered transactions & sum in transaction index
double-check storage rental values for 5 & 22
change running balances to have types
jeremy & zena pw issues
user-specific privacy settings & notification signup
deploy on amazon
